Prompt user for height
If height < 1 or > 8 (or not an integer ), go back to line 1 and re-prompt
Repeat from 1 through height:
On iteration i, print j dots/spaces and i hashes, then make a new line
On iteration i+1, print (j-1) dots/spaces and (i+1) hashes, then make a new line
Repeat line five as many times as prompted.
